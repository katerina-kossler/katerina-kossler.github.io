    <h1>Prior Experience</h1>
    <p>
        After getting my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from UC Berkeley, I
        joined Zymergen, an innovative, fast-paced biotechnology start-up
        that leverages automation and machine learning to develop novel
        products & materials and to produce highly improved strains. 
        Over the past 1.5 years at this company, I have expanded my 
        scientific and technical knowledge through working on a diverse set 
        of projects:
        <ul id="projects">
            <li>Development of Python-based tools: an outlier detection tool & a data processing script</li>
            <li>UAT of new data models & data processing tools</li>
            <li>Develeopment & Implementation of screening methods to a production environment</li>
            <li>DoE for high-throughput strain screening & Plate Screen
            Development</li>
            <li>Testing & client promotion of in-house built strains</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>HackBright Academy</h1>
    <p>
       I am currently studying in HackBright Academy's full-stack web 
       development course. In this cousrse, I am developing a full-stack web
       application using a Python backend, flask web framework with Jinja 
       templating, an open-source API, SQLAlchemy to access information, and 
       Javascript. 
    </p>

    <h2>Hiking Habit</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently working on my first full-stack web app that will be built using Python, SQLALchemy, & React that allows users to find local trails in their area, filter trails by key attributes, record hikes, leave reviews on hikes, and monitor their progress towards hiking goal(s).

<section id="interests">
    <p>
      On weekends, you can find me backpacking in a state or national park, reading a novel by the likes of Murakami or Celeste Ng, grabbing a pint at a local favorite like Novel or Fieldworks, or playing board games like Sushi Go Party! or Hanabi.
