      <h2>Prior Experience</h2>
      <p>
          After getting my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from UC Berkeley, I
          joined Zymergen, an innovative, fast-paced biotechnology start-up
          that leverages automation and machine learning to develop novel
          products & materials and to produce highly improved strains. 
          Over the past 1.5 years at this company, I have expanded my 
          scientific and technical knowledge through working on a diverse set 
          of projects:
          <ul id="projects">
              <li>Development of Python-based tools: an outlier detection tool & a data processing script</li>
              <li>UAT of new data models & data processing tools</li>
              <li>Develeopment & Implementation of screening methods to a production environment</li>
              <li>DoE for high-throughput strain screening & Plate Screen
              Development</li>
              <li>Testing & client promotion of in-house built strains</li>
              <li></li>
          </ul>

      <h2>HackBright Academy</h2>
      <p>
         I am currently studying in HackBright Academy's full-stack web 
         development course. In this cousrse, I am developing a full-stack web
         application using a Python backend, flask web framework with Jinja 
         templating, an open-source API, SQLAlchemy to access information, and 
         Javascript. 
      </p>

      <h3>Hiking Habit</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently working on my first full-stack web app that will be built using Python, SQLALchemy, & React that allows users to find local trails in their area, filter trails by key attributes, record hikes, leave reviews on hikes, and monitor their progress towards hiking goal(s).

      <p>
        On weekends, you can find me backpacking in a state or national park, reading a novel by the likes of Murakami or Celeste Ng, grabbing a pint at a local favorite like Novel or Fieldworks, or playing board games like Sushi Go Party! or Hanabi.
