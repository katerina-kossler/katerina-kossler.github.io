    <h2>Prior Experience</h2>
    <p>
        After getting my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from UC Berkeley, I
        joined Zymergen, an innovative, fast-paced biotechnology start-up
        that leverages automation and machine learning to develop novel
        products & materials and to produce highly improved strains. 
        Over the past 1.5 years at this company, I have expanded my 
        scientific and technical knowledge through working on a diverse set 
        of projects:
        <ul id="projects">
            <li>DoE for high-throughput strain screening & Plate Screen
            Development</li>
            <li>Testing & client promotion of in-house built strains</li>
            <li>UAT of new data models & data processing tools</li>
            <li>Development of a Python-based outlier detection tool</li>
        </ul>
